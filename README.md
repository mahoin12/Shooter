# Shooter

## This is my second assignment i did this job in 1 day june 2022

## What they want from me;

>${\color{gold}Step 1 }$

```yaml
• Create a new project by selecting the "First Person" template project with C++.
• Implement a limited ammo mechanic to the player. The ammo amount is the number of bullets that the player can use by shooting.
The maximum amount of ammo should be editable in the editor.
• Set the minimum ammo amount to 0 and set the maximum ammo amount however you want. If the player gets out of ammo, s/he cannot
fire the weapon.
• Create pick-up objects that increase the ammo amount of the player on the overlap. Eachpick up carries a different amount of 
ammo, and it should be editable in the editor.
```

>${\color{gold}Step 2}$
```yaml
• Place two characters (which you made Step1) into the scene.
• Add a function that allows users to switch between characters by pressing "P".
```
>${\color{gold}Step 3}$
```yaml
• Create a UI that displays the ammo amount of the player. Then, when players switch to other players, UI shows the ammo of the
controlling character.
```
>${\color{gold}Step 4}$
```yaml
• Create a dummy stable (non-moving) enemy.
• The enemy has 100 health points.
• Implement a health bar above enemies that indicates current health and full health.
• Implement the shooting mechanic. Players can shoot with the weapon and hit the enemy.
• When players hit the enemy, enemy health should decrease randomly between 5 and 10 health points.
• When enemy health is equal and lower than 0, the enemy will die.
```
>${\color{gold}Step 5}$
```yaml
• Create another type of enemy that has the same functionalities as the enemy you created before (in Step 4). But this enemy will
walk to the players when they entered the enemy’s range (You can decide the range).
```
>${\color{gold}Step 6}$
```yaml
• Create another pick-up object that increases the players’ maximum amount of ammo.
```
